This document serves as a temporary place for enumerating all the relevant links, docs, textbooks, videos.

### Some Examples 
https://rarible.com/   <--- this is a typical digital asset trading platform. Creators "mint" a token which is associated with one digital asset (which can be anything, pictures, videos, even a text) then anyone with a ETH wallet can trade

https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks <--- this is the very old one, it creates a bunch of pixelated pictures then just sell the "ownership" to others. No "minting" allowed, so the owner of the website is also the original owner of the artworks

https://opensea.io/ <-- the largest NFT trading platform, they seem to start using IPFS too. But the idea is still a trading platform. owners don't know what to do with your collections other than showing off or juse sell.

https://www.sandbox.game/en/ <--- very similar to my idea of selling properties but it's too complicated. 

## The ideas
I. Secrete Boxes (or not secrete). Focus on mobile platform. Trading is the same as most of the above trading platforms. Storage should use IPFS, but the more important part is we should let owners to show off, share and play with those toys.
So the trading platform is the same with more focus on how to randomly shuffle the boxes FAIRLY and also how to store data safely

II. The idea is we allow users to have the access to some place (a land, a cabinet, a tomb, a billboard etc) which are guaranteed to exist forever (but the rendering websites or apps might disappear so we should open source the read-only access for others to use. Others can host our data freely and earn ads if they want to). The properties can be leased or permanently owned.

In the extremely "decentralized" design, users should NOT need a "website" they can directly interact with others and trade with others. The websites serve for "listing" available stuff, or render the data in a very appealing way for users to experience better "ownership". So the business models for contract and websites can be independent to each other.

## Relevant Stuff
[solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) The best programming language for smart contract (NFT, coins whatever)
[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) A client lib for interacting with contracts deployed on chains [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/) An alternative JS client
[hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) The framework for developing solidity smart contract + some tools
[A contract template standard](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) They claim to verify their logics and can audit your work to make sure security is high
Metamask is the browswer plugin for ETH wallets.

[looking glass](https://lookingglassfactory.com/looking-glass-portrait) A real 3d display hardware. My idea is that we can use head-tracking on phones to achieve naked-eye 3D for people to enjoy their toys. Or we can also sell hardwards.
